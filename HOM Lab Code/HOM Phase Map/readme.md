This directory contains code used for table-top experiments associated with the higher-order Hermite-Gaussian laser modes.

1. Directory "SLM AMP Map" can be used to generate efficiency modulated blazed grating profiles for beam amplitude modulation, such as for beam size modulation and lateral offset modulation;

2. Directory "SLM Phase Map" can be used to generate beam phase profile modulation, such as for the beam wavefront defocus modulation and tilt modulation;

3. "BlazedGrating.py" can be used to generate blazed grating profiles with constant efficiency;

4. "HOMlab.py" contains functions for generated the checkerboard shaped phase profiles up to the HG99;

5. "phaseMaps.py" generated the checkerboard shaped phase profiles;

6. "phasePlusBlazedGrating.py" generated phase profiles modified by the blazed grating profiles to spatially separate the modulated light from the unmodulated light.
